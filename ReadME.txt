Make sure that you have downloaded and installed xorisso, to get the image file. Xorisso is not in bare linux.

Link: https://www.gnu.org/software/xorriso/

After extraction go into the folder: /wyoos-0d1984e1f08cc2b0075414cb61e1780e760c6914, then open terminal here. 

Then run: "make mykernel.iso" file to get iso image to run on a virtual machine.

Any virtual machine would be ok, for the development VMBox is used.
